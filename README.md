- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PatrickGillam
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m in GitHub to participate in a Multiverse School class.
- ðŸŒ± I know next to nothing about coding! My career was in marketing. I wrote software for meat-based operating systems.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He etc.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I know how to perform a puja to Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, which involves singing in Sanskrit!
